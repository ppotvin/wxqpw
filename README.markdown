# wxQPW - Other widgets for wxWidgets

This repo stores some new widgets I'm working on. As they are useful for any project, I try to put them in a easily integrable way.

I intend to assemble a pack of many widgets that will always follow the development of wxWidgets. The widgets will always at least support wxGTK and wxMSW.

Please use and test those widgets, and feel free to propose changes if needed.

## wxIconTextCtrl
This first widget will enable the use of icons inside a wxTextCtrl, as the GtkEntry already does. The wxGTK is already done, and the wxMSW should follow soon.
